JSON Mail Access Protocol Specification (JMAP)
----------------------------------------------

This repository contains the specification for JMAP, a new JSON-based API for synchronising a mail client with a mail server. It is intended as a replacement for IMAP. The specification is based on the API currently used by the FastMail (https://www.fastmail.fm) web app.  It aims to be compatible with the IMAP data model, so that it can be easily implemented on a server that currently supports IMAP, but allows for reduced data usage and more efficient synchronisation, bundling of requests for latency mitigation and is generally much easier to work with than IMAP.

The specification is still evolving. Parts are imprecise, incomplete, or could simply be done better in another way. Please send feedback to editor@jmap.io with any suggestions, corrections or other comments, or make a pull request. In particular, please see the sections marked "Discussion points" below, for areas I am interested in feedback on.
