# JMAP: The Spec

<div id="last-update">Last updated 2015-07-20</div>

This is a specification. It is meant to be readable but it also has to be comprehensive, so it can be dense in places. If you want to get a quick idea of how JMAP works, you should probably read the [guide for client developers](client.html) first. This has lots of example exchanges and should give you a good feel for what JMAP is all about. The spec is heavier going; it attempts to document exactly what each method should do, and what should happen in a myriad of edge cases.

There are undoubtably edge cases that are not yet covered. If you find one, please email <editor@jmap.io> or make a pull request on GitHub if you have a proposed fix.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## The JSON API model

JSON is a text-based data interchange format as specified in [RFC7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159). All data sent from the client to the server or from the server to the client MUST be valid JSON according to the RFC, encoded in UTF-8.

### The structure of an exchange

The client initiates an API request by sending the server a JSON array. Each element in this array is another array and constitutes passing a **message** to the server. The server will process this and return a response consisting of an array of messages in the same format. A message array always contains three elements:

1. The **name** of the message, a `String` specifying the method to be called on the server, or the type of response being sent to the client.
2. An `Object` containing *named* **arguments** for that method or response.
3. A **client id**, an arbitrary `String` to be echoed back with the responses emitted by that method call (as we'll see lower down, a method may return 1 or more responses, especially as some methods make implicit calls to other ones).

Example query:

    [
      ["method1", {"arg1": "arg1data", "arg2": "arg2data"}, "#1"],
      ["method2", {"arg1": "arg1data"}, "#2"],
      ["method3", {}, "#3"]
    ]

The method calls MUST be processed sequentially, in order. Each API request
(which, as shown, may contain multiple method calls) receives a JSON
response in exactly the same format. The output of the methods MUST be added
to the array in the same order in which the methods are processed.

Example response:

    [
      ["responseFromMethod1", {"arg1": 3, "arg2": "foo"}, "#1"],
      ["responseFromMethod2", {"isBlah": true}, "#2"],
      ["anotherResponseFromMethod2", {"data": 10, "yetmoredata": "Hello"}, "#2"],
      ["aResponseFromMethod3", {}, "#3"]
    ]

### Errors

If the data sent as an API request is not valid JSON or does not match the structure above, an error will be returned at the transport level. For example, when using JMAP over HTTP, a `400 Bad Request` error will be returned at the HTTP level.

Possible errors for each method are specified in the method descriptions. If a method encounters an error, an `error` message must be inserted at the current point in the response and, unless otherwise specified, no further processing must happen within that method.

Any further method calls in the request MUST then be processed as normal.

An `error` message looks like this:

    ["error", {
      type: "unknownMethod"
    }, "client-id"]

The response name is `error`, and it has a type property as specified in the method description. Other properties may be present with further information; these are detailed in the method descriptions where appropriate.

If an unknown method is called, an `unknownMethod` error (this is the type shown in the example above) must be inserted and then the next method call processed as normal.

### JMAP over HTTPS

To make an API request over HTTP (support for other protocols may be added in future extensions to the spec), the client makes an authenticated POST request to the API URL; see the Authentication section of the spec for how to discover this URL and how to authenticate requests. The request MUST have a content type of `application/json` and be encoded in utf-8. The server will respond with one of the following:

#### `200`: OK

The API request was successful. The response will be of type `application/json` and consists of the response to the API calls, as described above.

#### `400`: Bad Request

The request was malformed. For example, it may have had the wrong content type, or have had a JSON object that did not conform to the API calling structure (see *The structure of an exchange* above). The client SHOULD NOT retry the same request.

#### `401`: Unauthorized

The `Authorization` header was missing or did not contain a valid token. Reauthenticate and then retry the request. There is no content in the response.

#### `404`: Not Found

The API endpoint has moved. See the Authentication section of the spec for how to rediscover the current URL to use. There is no content in the response.

#### `500`: Internal Server Error

Something has gone wrong internally, and the server is in a broken state. Don't automatically retry. There is no content in the response.

#### `503`: Service Unavailable

The server is currently down. Try again later with exponential backoff. There is no content in the response.

### Security

As always, the server must be strict about data received from the client. Arguments need to be checked for validity; a malicious user could attempt to find an exploit through the API. In case of invalid arguments (unknown/insufficient/wrong type for data etc.) the method should return an `invalidArguments` error and terminate.

### Concurrency

To ensure the client always sees a consistent view of the data, the state accessed by a method call must not change during the execution of the method, except due to actions by the method call itself. The state may change in-between method calls (even within a single API request).

### The Number datatype

The JSON datatypes are limited to those found in JavaScript. A `Number` in JavaScript is represented as a signed double (64-bit floating point). However, except where explicitly specified, all numbers used in this API are unsigned integers <= 2^53 (the maximum integer that may be reliably stored in a double). This implicitly limits the maximum length of message lists in queries and the like.

### The Date datatypes

Where the API specifies `Date` as a type, it means a string in [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) *date-time* format, with the *time-offset* component always `Z` (i.e. the date-time MUST be in UTC time) and *time-secfrac* always omitted. The "T" and "Z" MUST always be upper-case. For example, `"2014-10-30T14:12:00Z"`.

Where the API specifies `LocalDate` as a type, it means a string in the same format as `Date`, but with the `Z` omitted from the end. This only occurs in relation to calendar event recurrences, due to the need for them to be expanded and interpreted in local time for a particular time zone. The interpretation in absolute time depends upon the time zone for the event, which MAY not be a fixed offset (for example when daylight savings occurs).

### Use of `null`

Unless otherwise noted, a missing property in a request, response or object MUST be intepreted exactly the same as that property having the value `null` If `null` is not a valid value for that property this would typically cause an error to occur. This rule does not apply to the [top-level datatypes](#data-model-overview), where a missing property usually indicates that the sender wants to leave the existing property value untouched (e.g. in a [`setFoos`](#setfoos) request or a [`getFooUpdates`](#getfooupdates) response.

### Unknown arguments and properties

For compatibility with possible future extensions, the server MUST ignore any unknown arguments to a method. This does not automatically generate an `invalidArguments` error.

Similarly, for *getRecords* type calls that take a *properties* argument. The server MUST ignore any unknown properties requested and not treat this as an error.

### CRUD methods

JMAP defines various types of objects and provides a uniform interface for creating, retrieving, updating and deleting them. A **data type** is a collection of named, typed properties, just like the schema for a database table. Each row of the table is a **record**. For a `Foo` data type, records of that type would be fetched via a `getFoos` call and modified via a `setFoos` call. Delta updates may be fetched via a `getFooUpdates` call. These methods all follow a standard format as described below.

### getFoos

Objects of type **Foo** are fetched via a call to *getFoos*. Methods starting with `get` MUST NOT alter state on the server.

This method may take some or all of the following arguments. The getter for a particular data type may not implement all of the arguments (for example if the data type only has two properties, there is little point in being able to just return one of them etc.); see the docs of the type in question. However, if one of the following arguments is available, it will behave exactly as specified below.

- **ids**: `String[]|null`
  The ids of the Foo objects to return. If `null` then **all** records of the data type are returned.
- **properties**: `String[]|null`
  If supplied, only the properties listed in the array are returned for each Foo object. If `null`, all properties of the object are returned. The id of the object is **always** returned, even if not explicitly requested. For compatibility with possible future extensions, the server MUST simply ignore any unknown properties in the list.
- **sinceState**: `String|null`
  The *state* argument from a *foos* response may be passed back to future *getFoos* calls as the *sinceState* argument. If the current state is the same, the server SHOULD skip fetching the records and return a result indicating there is no change (this is essentially like an ETag). Most types support the more sophisticated *getFooUpdates* call instead to allow for delta updates. However, for small collections of data that change infrequently, this might be used. If available, this argument is always optional.

The response to `getFoos` is called `foos`. It has the following arguments:

- **state**: `String`
  A string representing the state on the server for **all** the data of this type. If the data changes, this string will change. It is used to get delta updates, if supported for the type.
- **list**: `Foo[]|null`
  An array of the Foo objects requested. This is the **empty array** if no objects were requested, or none were found. If *sinceState* was supplied and it is identical to the current state, this property is `null`.
- **notFound**: `String[]|null`
  This array contains the ids passed to the method for records that do not exist, or `null` if all requested ids were found. It will always be `null` if the *ids* argument in the call was `null`.

### getFooUpdates

When the state of the set of Foo records changes on the server (whether due to creation, updates or deletion), the *state* property of the *foos* response will change. The *getFooUpdates* call allows a client to efficiently update the state of any its Foo cache to match the new state on the server. It takes the following arguments:

- **sinceState**: `String`
  The current state of the client. This is the string that was returned as the *state* argument in the *foos* response. The server will return the changes made since this state.
- **maxChanges**: `Number|null`
  The maximum number of changed Foos to return in the response. See below for a more detailed description.
- **fetchRecords**: `Boolean|null`
  If `true`, after outputting the *fooUpdates* response, the server will make an implicit call to *getFoos* with the *changed* property of the response as the *ids* argument. If `false` or `null`, no implicit call will be made.
- **fetchRecordProperties**: `String[]|null`
  If the *getFoos* method takes a *properties* argument, this argument is passed through on implicit calls (see the *fetchRecords* argument).

If there are too many changes on the server and the client is only keeping a partial cache, it may be more efficient for the client to just invalidate its entire cache and fetch what it needs on demand. The *maxChanges* argument allows the client to tell the server the maximum number of changes to send back. The server will return a `tooManyChanges` error if the number of changes exceeds the *maxChanges* argument. The client can treat this like a `cannotCalculateChanges` error and invalidate its entire Foo cache.

The response to *getFooUpdates* is called *fooUpdates*. It has the following arguments:

- **oldState**: `String`
  This is the *sinceState* argument echoed back; the state from which the server is returning changes.
- **newState**: `String`
  This is the state the client will be in after applying the set of changes to the old state.
- **changed**: `String[]`
  An array of Foo ids for records which have been created or changed but not destroyed since the oldState.
- **removed**: `String[]`
  An array of Foo ids for records which have been destroyed since the old state.

If a Foo record has been modified AND deleted since the oldState, the server should just return the id in the *removed* response, but MAY return it in the changed response as well. If a Foo record has been created AND deleted since the oldState, the server should remove the Foo id from the response entirely, but MAY include it in the *removed* response, and optionally the *changed* response as well.

The following errors may be returned instead of the *fooUpdates* response:

`invalidArguments`: Returned if the request does not include one of the required arguments, or one of the arguments is of the wrong type, or otherwise invalid. A *description* property MAY be present on the response object to help debug with an explanation of what the problem was.

`tooManyChanges`: Returned if there are more changes the the client's *maxChanges* argument. The client can either invalidate its Foo cache or perhaps try again with a higher *maxChanges* argument but `fetchRecords: false`.

`cannotCalculateChanges`: Returned if the server cannot calculate the changes from the state string given by the client. Usually due to the client's state being too old. The client MUST invalidate its Foo cache.

### setFoos

Modifying the state of Foo objects on the server is done via the *setFoos* method. This encompasses creating, updating and destroying Foo records. This has two benefits:

1. It allows the server to sort out ordering and dependencies that may exist if doing multiple operations at once (for example to ensure there is always a minimum number of a certain record type).
2. Only a single call is required to make all changes to a particular type, so the *ifInState* requirement will not be invalidated by a previous method call in the same request.

The *setFoos* method takes the following arguments:

- **ifInState**: `String|null`
  This is a state string as returned by the *getFoos* method. If supplied, the string must match the current state, otherwise the method will be aborted and a `stateMismatch` error returned. If `null`, the change will be applied to the current state.
- **create**: `String[Foo]|null`
  A map of *creation id* (an arbitrary string set by the client) to Foo objects (containing all properties except the id, unless otherwise stated in the specific documentation of the data type). If `null`, no objects will be created.
- **update**: `String[Foo]|null`
  A map of id to a Foo object. The object may omit any property; only properties that have changed need be included. If `null`, no objects will be updated.
- **destroy**: `String[]|null`
  A list of ids for Foo objects to permanently delete. If `null`, no objects will be deleted.

Each create, update or destroy is considered an atomic unit. It is permissible for the server to commit some of the changes but not others, however it is not permissible to only commit part of an update to a single record (e.g. update a *name* property but not a *count* property, if both are supplied in the update object).

If a create, update or destroy is rejected, the appropriate error should be added to the notCreated/notUpdated/notDestroyed property of the response and the server MUST continue to the next create/update/destroy. It does not terminate the method.

Some record objects may hold references to others (foreign keys). When records are created or modified, they may reference other records being created *in the same API request* by using the creation id prefixed with a `#`. The order of the method calls in the request by the client MUST be such that the record being referenced is created in the same or an earlier call. The server thus never has to look ahead. Instead, while processing a request (a series of method calls), the server MUST keep a simple map for the duration of the request of creation id to record id for each newly created record, so it can substitute in the correct value if necessary in later method calls.

The response to *setFoos* is called *foosSet*. It has the following arguments:

- **oldState**: `String|null`
  The state string that would have been returned by *getFoos* before making the requested changes, or `null` if the server doesn't know what the previous state string was.
- **newState**: `String`
  The state string that will now be returned by *getFoos*.
- **created**: `String[Foo]`
  A map of the creation id to an object containing any **server-assigned** properties of the Foo object (including the id) for all successfully created records.
- **updated**: `String[]`
  A list of Foo ids for records that were successfully updated.
- **destroyed**: `String[]`
  A list of Foo ids for records that were successfully destroyed.
- **notCreated**: `String[SetError]`
  A map of creation id to a SetError object for each record that failed to be created. The possible errors are defined in the description of the method for specific data types.
- **notUpdated**: `String[SetError]`
  A map of Foo id to a SetError object for each record that failed to be updated. The possible errors are defined in the description of the method for specific data types.
- **notDestroyed**: `String[SetError]`
  A map of Foo id to a SetError object for each record that failed to be destroyed. The possible errors are defined in the description of the method for specific data types.

A **SetError** object has the following properties:

- **type**: `String`
  The type of error.
- **description**: `String|null`
  A description of the error to display to the user.

Other properties may also be present on the object, as described in the relevant methods.

The following errors may be returned instead of the `foosSet` response:

`invalidArguments`: Returned if one of the arguments is of the wrong type, or otherwise invalid. A `description` property MAY be present on the response object to help debug with an explanation of what the problem was.

`stateMismatch`: Returned if an `ifInState` argument was supplied and it does not match the current state.
