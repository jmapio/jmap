## Vacation Response

The **VacationResponse** object represents the state of vacation-response
related settings for an account. It has the following properties:

- **id**: `String`
  The id of the object. This property is immutable. There is only ever one
  vacation response object, and its id is `"singleton"`.
- **isEnabled** `Boolean`
  Is the vacation response enabled?
- **isActivated** `Boolean|null`
  Server set property. It will be ignored in the client request. It will return true if the enabled value is true, and if we are currently in the time range between fromDate and toDate, ie : when eMail replies will be generated based on this vacationReply.
- **fromDate**: `Date|null`
  If *isEnabled* is `true`, the date/time after which messages that arrive should receive the user's vacation response, in UTC. If `null`, the vacation response is effective immediately.
- **toDate**: `Date|null`
  If *isEnabled* is `true`, the date/time after which messages that arrive should no longer receive the user's vacation response, in UTC. If `null`, the vacation response is effective indefinitely.
- **subject**: `String|null`
  The subject that will be used by the mail sent in response to messages when the vacation response is enabled. If null, an appropriate subject SHOULD be set by the server.
- **textBody**: `String|null`
  The plain text part of the message to send in response to messages when the vacation response is enabled. If there is only an HTML version of the body, a plain text version SHOULD be generated from this.
- **htmlBody**: `String|null`
  The plain text message to send in response to messages when the vacation response is enabled. If there is only a plain text version of the body, an HTML version MAY be generated from this, or it may be sent as plain-text only.

### getVacationResponse

There MUST only be exactly one VacationResponse object in an account. It MUST have the id `"singleton"`.

To fetch the vacation response object, make a call to `getVacationResponse`. It takes the following argument:

- **accountId**: `String|null`
  The Account to get the vacation response for. If `null`, the primary account is used.

The response to *getVacationResponse* is called *vacationResponse*. It has the following arguments:

- **accountId**: `String`
  The id of the account used for the call.
- **list**: `VacationResponse[]`
  An array containing the single VacationResponse object.

The following errors may be returned instead of the *vacationResponse* response:

`accountNotFound`: Returned if an *accountId* was explicitly included with the request, but it does not correspond to a valid account.

`accountNotSupportedByMethod`: Returned if the *accountId* given corresponds to a valid account, but the account does not support this data type.

### setVacationResponse

Sets properties on the vacation response object. It takes the following arguments:

- **accountId**: `String|null`
  The Account to set the vacation response for. If `null`, the primary account is used.
- **update**: `String[VacationResponse]|null`
  A map of id ("singleton") to the VacationResponse object with new values for the properties you wish to change. The object may omit any property; only properties that have changed need be included.

If any of the properties in the update are invalid (immutable and different to the current server value, wrong type), the server MUST reject the update with a SetError of type `invalidProperties`. The SetError object SHOULD contain a property called *properties* of type `String[]` that lists **all** the properties that were invalid. The object MAY also contain a *description* property of type `String` with a user-friendly description of the problems.

The response is called *vacationResponseSet*. It has the following arguments:

- **updated**: `String[]`
  Contains the single id ("singleton") if the vacation response was successfully updated.
- **notUpdated**: `String[SetError]`
  A map of id ("singleton") to a SetError object if the update failed.

A **SetError** object has the following properties:

- **type**: `String`
  The type of error.
- **description**: `String|null`
  A description of the error to display to the user.

The following errors may be returned instead of the *vacationResponseSet* response:

`accountNotFound`: Returned if an *accountId* was explicitly included with the request, but it does not correspond to a valid account.

`accountNotSupportedByMethod`: Returned if the *accountId* given corresponds to a valid account, but the account does not support this data type.

`invalidArguments`: Returned if one of the arguments is of the wrong type, or otherwise invalid (including using an id other than `"singleton"`). A `description` property MAY be present on the response object to help debug with an explanation of what the problem was.
