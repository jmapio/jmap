## Accounts

A single login may provide access to multiple accounts, for example if another user is sharing their mail with the logged in user.

All data belongs to an account. With the exception of a few explicit operations to copy data between accounts, all methods take an *accountId* argument that specifies on which account the operations are to take place. This argument is always optional; if not specified, the primary account is used. All ids (other than Account ids of course) are only unique within their account.

An **Account** object has the following properties:

- **id**: `String`
  The id of the account.
- **name**: `String`
  A user-friendly string to show when presenting content from this account. e.g. the email address of the account.
- **isPrimary**: `Boolean`
  This MUST be true for exactly one of the accounts returned.
- **isReadOnly**: `Boolean`
  True if the user has read-only access to this account. The user may not use the `set` methods with this account.
- **hasMail**: `Boolean`
  This account contains mail data. Clients may use the Mail methods with this account.
- **hasContacts**: `Boolean`
  This account contains contact data. Clients may use the Contacts methods with this account.
- **hasCalendars**: `Boolean`
  This account contains calendar data. Clients may use the Calendar methods with this account.
- **capabilities**: `Capabilities`
  An object describing various capabilities of this server.

A **Capabilities** object has the following properties

TODO:

- delayedSend?
- maxSendSize?
- supportsMultiMailbox?
- supportsThreads?

### getAccounts

To fetch the complete list of accounts to which the user has access, make a call to `getAccounts`. It takes a sole, optional argument:

- **sinceState**: `String|null`
  This is the `state` string from a previous call to *getAccounts*.

The response to *getAccounts* is called *accounts*. It has the following arguments:

- **state**: `String`
   A string representing the state on the server for **all** the data contained within the Account objects. If the data changes, this string will change.
- **list**: `Account[]|null`
  An array of all Account objects. If *sinceState* was supplied and it is identical to the current state, this property is `null`.

The following errors may be returned instead of the `accounts` response:

`invalidArguments`: Returned if the `sinceState` argument is included and has the wrong type.

Example of a successful request:

    ["getAccounts", {}, "#0"]

and response:

    [ "accounts", {
      "state": "f6a7e214",
      "list": [
        {
          "id": "6asf5",
          "name": "user@example.com",
          "isPrimary": true,
          "isReadOnly": false,
          "hasMail": true,
          "hasContacts": true,
          "hasCalendars": true
        },
        {
          "id": "e12e1a",
          "name": "shared.user@example.com",
          "isPrimary": false,
          "isReadOnly": true,
          "hasMail": true,
          "hasContacts": false,
          "hasCalendars": false
        }
      ]
    }, "#0" ]
