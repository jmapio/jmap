# Introduction

JMAP ([@!RFC8620] â€“ JSON Meta Application Protocol) is a generic protocol for synchronizing data, such as mail, calendars or contacts, between a client and a server. It is optimized for mobile and web environments, and aims to provide a consistent interface to different data types.

JMAP for Calendars ([@!I-D.ietf-jmap-calendars]) defines a data model for synchronizing calendar data between a client and a server using JMAP. The data model is designed to allow a server to provide consistent access to the same data via CalDAV [@?RFC4791] as well as JMAP.

While CalDAV defines access to tasks, JMAP for Calendars does not. This specification fills this gap and defines a data model for synchronizing task data between a client and a server using JMAP. It is built upon JMAP for Calendars and reuses most of its definitions. For better readability, this document only outlines differences between this specification and JMAP for Calendars. If not stated otherwise, the same specifics that apply to Calendar, CalendarEvent and CalendarEventNotification objects as defined in the aforementioned specification also apply to similar data types introduced in this specification.

## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [@!RFC2119] [@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

Type signatures, examples, and property descriptions in this document follow the conventions established in Section 1.1 of [@!RFC8620].  Data types defined in the core specification are also used in this document.

## The LocalDate Data Type

Where `LocalDate` is given as a type, it means a string in the same format as `Date` (see [@!RFC8620], Section 1.4), but with the `time-offset` omitted from the end. For example, `2014-10-30T14:12:00`. The interpretation in absolute time depends upon the time zone for the task, which may not be a fixed offset (for example when daylight saving time occurs).

## The Duration Data Type

Where `Duration` is given as a type, it means a length of time represented by a subset of the ISO 8601 duration format, as defined in [@!RFC8984], Section 1.4.6.

## Terminology

The same terminology is used in this document as in the core JMAP specification, see [@!RFC8620], Section 1.6.

The terms ParticipantIdentity, TaskList, Task and TaskNotification are used to refer to the data types defined in this document and instances of those data types.

## Data Model Overview

Similar to JMAP for Calendar, an Account (see [@!RFC8620], Section 1.6.2) contains zero or more TaskList objects, which is a named collection of Tasks belonging to a Principal (see [@!I-D.ietf-jmap-sharing] Section XXX). Task lists can also provide defaults, such as alerts and a color, to apply to tasks in the calendar. Clients commonly let users toggle visibility of tasks belonging to a particular task list on/off.

A Task is a representation of a single task or recurring series of Tasks in JSTask [@!RFC8984] format. Recurrence rules and alerts as defined in JMAP for Calendars (see [@!I-D.ietf-jmap-calendars] Section XXX) apply.

Just like the CalendarEventNotification objects (see [@!I-D.ietf-jmap-calendars] Section XXX), TaskNotification objects keep track of the history of changes made to a task by other users. Similarly, the ShareNotification type (see [@!I-D.ietf-jmap-sharing] Section XXX) notifies the user when their access to another user's task list is granted or revoked.

Use cases for task systems vary. Only a few systems will require implementation of all available features defined within this specification. For this reason, this document describes several extensions to the core task properties and objects through which support for a certain feature MUST be advertised via capabilities. In addition to the core features advertised via `urn:ietf:params:jmap:tasks` support for recurrences, assignees, alerts, localizations as well as custom time zones can be advertised. As defined in [@!RFC8620], servers SHOULD throw an "urn:ietf:params:jmap:error:unknownCapability" error when a client uses a capability that the server does not understand. However, a Task object might just contain data that the server does not understand. In this case, the server SHOULD save it and ignore its existence.

## Addition to the Capabilities Object

The capabilities object is returned as part of the JMAP Session object; see [@!RFC8620], Section 2. This document defines six additional capability URIs.

### urn:ietf:params:jmap:tasks

This represents support for the core properties and objects of the TaskList, Task and TaskNotification data types and associated API methods. The value of this property in the JMAP Session capabilities property is an empty object.

The value of this property in an account's accountCapabilities property is an object that MUST contain the following information on server capabilities and permissions for that account:

- **shareesActAs**: `String`
  This MUST be one of:

    - `self` - sharees act as themselves when using tasks in this account.
    - `secretary`- sharees act as the principal to which this account belongs.

- **minDateTime**: `LocalDate`
  The earliest date-time the server is willing to accept for any date stored in a Task.
- **maxDateTime**: `LocalDate`
  The latest date-time the server is willing to accept for any date stored in a Task.
- **mayCreateTaskList**: `Boolean`
  If true, the user may create a task list in this account.

### urn:ietf:params:jmap:tasks:recurrences

This represents support for the recurrence properties and objects of the TaskList, Task and TaskNotification data types and associated API methods. The value of this property in the JMAP Session capabilities property is an empty object.

The value of this property in an account's accountCapabilities property is an object that MUST contain the following information on server capabilities and permissions for that account:

- **maxExpandedQueryDuration**: `Duration`
  The maximum duration the user may query over when asking the server to expand recurrences.

### urn:ietf:params:jmap:tasks:assignees

This represents support for the assignee properties and objects of the TaskList, Task and TaskNotification data types and associated API methods. The value of this property in the JMAP Session capabilities property is an empty object.

The value of this property in an account's accountCapabilities property is an object that MUST contain the following information on server capabilities and permissions for that account:

- **maxParticipantsPerTask**: `Number|null`
  The maximum number of participants a single task may have, or null for no limit.

### urn:ietf:params:jmap:tasks:alerts

This represents support for the alerts properties and objects of the TaskList, Task and TaskNotification data types and associated API methods. The value of this property in the JMAP Session capabilities property and the account's accountCapabilities property is an empty object.

### urn:ietf:params:jmap:tasks:multilingual

This represents support for the multilingual properties and objects of the TaskList, Task and TaskNotification data types and associated API methods. The value of this property in the JMAP Session capabilities property and the account's accountCapabilities property is an empty object.

### urn:ietf:params:jmap:tasks:customtimezones

This represents support for the custom time zone properties and objects of the TaskList, Task and TaskNotification data types and associated API methods. The value of this property in the JMAP Session capabilities property and the account's accountCapabilities property is an empty object.
