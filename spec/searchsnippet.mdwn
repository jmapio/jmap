## SearchSnippets

When doing a search on a `String` property, the client may wish to show the relevant section of the body that matches the search as a preview instead of the beginning of the message, and to highlight any matching terms in both this and the subject of the message. Search snippets represent this data.

A **SearchSnippet** object has the following properties:

- **messageId**: `String`
  The message id the snippet applies to.
- **subject**: `String|null`
  If text from the filter matches the subject, this is the subject of the message HTML-escaped, with matching words/phrases wrapped in `<b></b>` tags. If it does not match, this is `null`.
- **preview**: `String|null`
  If text from the filter matches the plain-text or HTML body, this is the relevant section of the body (converted to plain text if originally HTML), HTML-escaped, with matching words/phrases wrapped in `<b></b>` tags, up to 256 characters long. If it does not match, this is `null`.

It is server-defined what is a relevant section of the body for preview. If the server is unable to determine search snippets, it MUST just return `null` for both the *subject* and *preview* properties.

Note, unlike most data types, a SearchSnippet DOES NOT have a property called `id`.

### getSearchSnippets

To fetch search snippets, make a call to `getSearchSnippets`. It takes the following arguments:

- **accountId**: `String|null`
  The id of the account to use for this call. If `null`, defaults to the primary account.
- **messageIds**: `String[]`
  The list of ids of messages to fetch the snippets for.
- **filter**: `FilterCondition|FilterOperator|null`
  The same filter as passed to getMessageList; see the description of this method for details.

The response to `getSearchSnippets` is called `searchSnippets`. It has the following arguments:

- **accountId**: `String`
  The id of the account used for the call.
- **filter**: `FilterOperator`
  Echoed back from the call.
- **list**: `SearchSnippet[]`
  An array of SearchSnippets objects for the requested message ids. This may not be in the same order as the ids that were in the request.
- **notFound**: `String[]|null`
  An array of message ids requested which could not be found, or `null` if all
  ids were found.

Since snippets are only based on immutable properties, there is no state string or update mechanism needed.
