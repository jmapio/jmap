# IANA Considerations
## JMAP Capability Registration for "mail"

IANA will register the "mail" JMAP Capability as follows:

Capability Name: `urn:ietf:params:jmap:mail`

Specification document: this document

Intended use: common

Change Controller: IETF

Security and privacy considerations: this document, section 9

## IMAP and JMAP Keywords Registry

This document makes two changes to the IMAP keywords registry as defined in [@!RFC5788].

First, the name of the registry is changed to the "IMAP and JMAP keywords Registry".

Second, a scope column is added to the template and registry indicating
whether a keyword applies to IMAP-only, JMAP-only, both, or reserved. All
keywords presently in the IMAP keyword registry will be marked with a
scope of both. The "reserved" status can be used to prevent future
registration of a name that would be confusing if registered.
Registration of keywords with scope 'reserved' omit most fields in the
registration template (see example for `$recent` subsection of this
section); such registrations are intended to be infrequent.

IMAP clients MAY silently ignore any keywords marked JMAP-only or
reserved in the event they appear in protocol. JMAP clients MAY silently
ignore any keywords marked IMAP-only or reserved in the event they appear
in protocol.

New JMAP-only keywords are registered in the following sub-sections.
These keywords correspond to IMAP system keywords and are thus not
appropriate for use in IMAP. These keywords can not be subsequently
registered for use in IMAP except via standards action.

### Registration of JMAP keyword '$draft'

This registers the JMAP-only keyword '$draft' in the "IMAP and JMAP keywords Registry".

Keyword name: `$draft`

Scope: JMAP-only

Purpose (description): This is set when the user wants to treat the
message as a draft the user is composing. This is the JMAP equivalent of the IMAP \Draft flag.

Private or Shared on a server: BOTH

Is it an advisory keyword or may it cause an automatic action:
Automatic. If the account has a mailbox marked with the \Drafts special
use [RFC6154], setting this flag MAY cause the message to appear in that
mailbox automatically. Certain JMAP computed values such as
*unreadEmails* will change as a result of changing this flag. In
addition, mail clients typically will present draft messages in a
composer window rather than a viewer window.

When/by whom the keyword is set/cleared:
This is typically set by a JMAP client when referring to a draft
message. One model for draft emails would result in clearing this flag
in an EmailSubmission/set operation with an onSuccessUpdateEmail
attribute. In a mailstore shared by JMAP and IMAP, this is also set and
cleared as necessary so it matches the IMAP \Draft flag.

Related keywords: None

Related IMAP/JMAP Capabilities: SPECIAL-USE [RFC6154]

Security Considerations:
A server implementing this keyword as a shared keyword may disclose that
a user considers the message a draft message. This information would be
exposed to other users with read permission for the mailbox keywords.

### Registration of JMAP keyword '$seen'

This registers the JMAP-only keyword '$seen' in the "IMAP and JMAP
keywords Registry".

Keyword name: `$seen`

Scope: JMAP-only

Purpose (description): This is set when the user wants to treat the
message as read. This is the JMAP equivalent of the IMAP \Seen flag.

Private or Shared on a server: BOTH

Is it an advisory keyword or may it cause an automatic action:
Advisory. However, certain JMAP computed values such as *unreadEmails*
will change as a result of changing this flag.

When/by whom the keyword is set/cleared:
This is set by a JMAP client when it presents the message content to the
user; clients often offer an option to clear this flag. In a mailstore
shared by JMAP and IMAP, this is also set and cleared as necessary so it
matches the IMAP \Seen flag.

Related keywords: None

Related IMAP/JMAP Capabilities: None

Security Considerations:
A server implementing this keyword as a shared keyword may disclose that
a user considers the message to have been read. This information would be
exposed to other users with read permission for the mailbox keywords.

### Registration of JMAP keyword '$flagged'

This registers the JMAP-only keyword '$flagged' in the "IMAP and JMAP
keywords Registry".

Keyword name: `$flagged`

Scope: JMAP-only

Purpose (description): This is set when the user wants to treat the
message as flagged for urgent/special attention. This is the JMAP
equivalent of the IMAP \Flagged flag.

Private or Shared on a server: BOTH

Is it an advisory keyword or may it cause an automatic action:
Automatic. If the account has a mailbox marked with the \Flagged special
use [RFC6154], setting this flag MAY cause the message to appear in that
mailbox automatically.

When/by whom the keyword is set/cleared:
JMAP clients typically allow a user to set/clear this flag as desired.
In a mailstore shared by JMAP and IMAP, this is also set and cleared as
necessary so it matches the IMAP \Flagged flag.

Related keywords: None

Related IMAP/JMAP Capabilities: SPECIAL-USE [RFC6154]

Security Considerations:
A server implementing this keyword as a shared keyword may disclose that
a user considers the message as flagged for urgent/special attention.
This information would be exposed to other users with read permission
for the mailbox keywords.

### Registration of JMAP keyword '$answered'

This registers the JMAP-only keyword '$answered' in the "IMAP and JMAP
keywords Registry".

Keyword name: `$answered`

Scope: JMAP-only

Purpose (description): This is set when the message has been answered.

Private or Shared on a server: BOTH

Is it an advisory keyword or may it cause an automatic action:
Advisory.

When/by whom the keyword is set/cleared:
JMAP clients typically set this when submitting a reply or answer to the
message. It may be set by the EmailSubmission/set operation with an
onSuccessUpdateEmail attribute. In a mailstore shared by JMAP and IMAP,
this is also set and cleared as necessary so it matches the IMAP
\Answered flag.

Related keywords: None

Related IMAP/JMAP Capabilities: None

Security Considerations:
A server implementing this keyword as a shared keyword may disclose that
a user considers the message as flagged for urgent/special attention.

### Registration of '$recent' Keyword

This registers the keyword '$recent' in the "IMAP and JMAP keywords Registry".

Keyword name: `$recent`

Scope: reserved

Purpose (description): This keyword is not used to avoid confusion with
the IMAP \Recent system flag.
