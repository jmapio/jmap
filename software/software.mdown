# JMAP software

JMAP is still young but several implementations already exist, and more are on the way. If you're working on a project that uses JMAP, please email the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jmap-discuss) and we'll add it here.


## Clients

* **[JMAP Demo Webmail](https://github.com/jmapio/jmap-demo-webmail)** (JavaScript, MIT): a sophisticated demo webmail client to be used as a base for new projects. Default client for the [proxy](https://proxy.jmap.io).
* **[JMAP::Tester](https://metacpan.org/pod/JMAP::Tester)** (Perl, Perl5): a JMAP client made for testing JMAP servers.


## Servers

* **[JMAP Proxy](https://github.com/jmapio/jmap-perl)** (Perl, MIT): a complete JMAP server implementation that uses any IMAP, CalDAV and CardDAV store as a backend. Also available as a hosted service at [proxy.jmap.io](https://proxy.jmap.io).
* **[Cyrus IMAP](https://cyrusimap.org/imap/download/release-notes/3.0/x/3.0.3.html)** (C, BSD-style): A scalable enterprise-grade IMAP, CalDAV and CardDAV server. The 3.0 series is adding JMAP support, instructions to enable it are [here](https://www.cyrusimap.org/dev/imap/developer/jmap.html).
* **[Apache James](http://james.apache.org/)** (Java, Apache): Apache James, a.k.a. Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server is an open source mail server written entirely in Java. The 3.0 series is adding JMAP support.


## Libraries

* **[JMAP-JS](https://github.com/jmapio/jmap-js)** (JavaScript, MIT): a full implementation of the JMAP mail, calendar and contacts model in JavaScript. It supports asynchronous local changes and is tolerant of network failure â€“ actions will update the UI instantly, then synchronise changes back to the server when it can. It also has multi-level undo/redo support. Used by the [demo webmail](https://github.com/jmapio/jmap-demo-webmail).
* **[jmap-client](https://github.com/linagora/jmap-client)** (JavaScript ES6, MIT): a simple promise-based API to send requests to a JMAP server.
* **[zend-jmap](https://github.com/WikiSuite/zend-jmap)** (PHP, New BSD): JMAP for Zend Framework
